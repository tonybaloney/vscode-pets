# Pets

## Playing with pets

Pets will interact with your mouse pointer within the open Pet Panel. Additionally, pets will display text bubbles as you move your mouse over the pet.

Once you've done this, select the pet type, color, and then choose a name or use the randomly assigned one.

If you have more than 1 pet, they become friends. When pets become friends, they will say a little "❤️" and then play chase with each other.

You can also click the squirrel icon in the bottom of the VS Code Window to create pets.

## Throwing a ball

Play catch with your pet! Click the ball icon in the VS Code Pets panel to throw the ball:

You can also use the "Throw ball" command (`vscode-pets.throw-ball`).

* Rocky will not run & catch a ball. Have you ever seen a rock run after a ball? Neither have we.

Want to challenge your pets to a harder game of fetch? Enable the "Throw ball with mouse" (`vscode-pets.throwBallWithMouse`) option in the settings.
Then use the mouse to click and throw the ball:
